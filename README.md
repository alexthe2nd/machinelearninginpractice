## Digit Recognition competition on [kaggle.com](https://kaggle.com/)
5th of March individual goal:
* Get TensowFlow running with a digit recognition algorithm. 
* Get familiar with the technology so that everyone can set up an environment fron zero without hickups.
* Learn how to export your model so you don't have to retrain the CNN 
again
* Get familiar with the technology so that everyone can set up an environment from zero without hickups.

### Roadmap
After everybody has been set up with the system, we're going to tweak the neural network. 
We can possibly split up the group in two subgroups. One subgroup will continue on tinkering the neural network, the other group will use other methods. In this way, we can use ensemble learning.
